// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = `This is the second step and a very important one. This step intails everything the project must be able to do.`

const design = `Design is the third step in the SDLC. This step goes over the details of how the code should look as well as setting up where and when processes happen.`

const implementation = `This is the fourth step. This is where the fun begins. This is where design becomes a reality. the design is turned into source code and in turn, the developers use this to start implimenting code into the project`

const testingAndIntegration = `This is the fifth step of the SDLC. The code implimented in step four is ran through rigorous tests to ensure the program is running properly. If there is an issues, this goes back to step four until testing is able to resume. Once running perfectly, we deploy the software to production to be accepted by the client or sometimes ran through 'User Acceptance Testing' to evaluate if the code is up to standards.`

const maintain = `This is the last step. After being deployed to production there might be issues that come to light. At that point, software developers can fix the bugs and even add additional features if the client requests it.`
